## Data Structure

Data Structures are the ways to organize data, read them, and work with them. These are the types of data structures: lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

```python
    # list
    list = [1, 2, 3]

    # tuple
    tuple = (1, 2, 3)

    # dictionary
    dictionary = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```
